# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repo contains a possible elaboration of the course project for the 'Getting and Cleaning Data' course. The relevant files to this course project are

* run_analysis.R: the R script that creates the requested tidy data set for this course project. To run this script, download the data files from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and unzip it to some local directory. The run_analysis.R script should be placed inside the same local directory to run correctly.
* CodeBook.md: a description of the variables, the data, and any transformations performed in the run_analysis.R script.
* README.md: this file.
